Project AdventureWorks2019: Company Analysis
This is an open Windows database, called AdventureWorks, which you can find at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms

It was used to carry out a case of a fictitious company where a report is made for its different areas and an analysis of them, these six areas would be:
- Purchase
- Production
- Depot
- You go out
- HR
- Customers

In this folder you will find only two files:
1) A .pbix that contains the report of the six areas of the company
2) A .pdf that contains how the report was built and a small analysis of each area.

You can view the file online through the following link:
